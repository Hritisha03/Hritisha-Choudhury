# Hey there! I'm Hritisha üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I'm a CS undergrad and a reader in India.

I'm currently pursueing my undergraduate from KIIT university.

I'm exploring:
- **Web Development** - designing and developing interactive, responsive UI.
- **Data Structures and Algorithm** - strengthening my problem-solving skills, one algorithm at a time.
- **Human Computer Interaction** - understanding how people connect with technology and designing experiences that put humans first.

I'm fascinated by the way technology shapes our experiences ‚Äî from stunning 3D websites to powerful AI tools ‚Äî and how these innovations help us solve real-world problems and connect with each other in remarkable ways.

Outside studies, I'm interested in classic literature, an art enthusiast and a lifelong learner.I love reading books, dancing and exploring innovations in science and technology.I find happiness in creativity ‚Äî whether it's learning a new choreo, writing code, or losing myself in a good book.
